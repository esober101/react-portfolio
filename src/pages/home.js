                    Hello! My name is Eric. I graduated with a degree in business from 
                    Cincinnati State Technical and Community College in Cincinnati, Ohio.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Currently, I am working as a Director of Operations where I strategically safeguard 
                    and augment the efficiency of the companyâ€™s operations to facilitate the accelerating 
                    development and the long-term success of the business. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I have enrolled in the Coding Bootcamp at the Ohio State University to learn new 
                    tools and skills. Please feel free to browse my portfolio.
